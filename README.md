# Sklearn Basics and Machine Learning Models
This notebook explores fundamental concepts in scikit-learn and demonstrates various machine learning models, including:

Data Preprocessing
Loading and inspecting data: Demonstrates loading datasets like Iris and Titanic, and examining their structure and missing values.
Handling Missing Values: Shows how to identify and impute missing values in a dataset using SimpleImputer.
Regression Models
Linear Regression: Implements and evaluates a basic Linear Regression model.
Ridge Regression: Explores Ridge Regression and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
Lasso Regression: Demonstrates Lasso Regression and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
Model Evaluation: Compares the performance of different regression models using R2 score.
Classification Models
Logistic Regression: Implements and evaluates a Logistic Regression model, including checking for class balance and using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
Decision Tree Classifier: Demonstrates a Decision Tree Classifier, including visualization of the tree and applying post-pruning techniques (max_depth).
Hyperparameter Tuning for Decision Trees: Shows how to use GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for a Decision Tree Classifier (pre-pruning).
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the performance of the Decision Tree Classifier using accuracy and classification report.
Dimensionality Reduction
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Applies PCA to a dataset for dimensionality reduction and visualizes the results.
Clustering
K-Means Clustering: Demonstrates K-Means clustering, including using the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters and evaluating clustering performance using Silhouette analysis.
